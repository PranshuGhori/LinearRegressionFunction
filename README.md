🧮 LinearRegressionFunction

Overview

This repository documents my learning and hands-on exploration of data analysis and regression modeling using Python.
The main focus is on building a Simple Linear Regression function from scratch (without using scikit-learn) to understand the mathematics, logic, and performance metrics behind the model.

Along the way, I have also completed descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) exercises to strengthen my statistical foundation before moving into regression and machine learning.
